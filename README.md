# PhysicsForGame

This was an Assignments For AIE to make a physic engine.

Physic Shapes is the physic engine project.
ShapesRend was my first attempt, but decide to redo it all from scratch.
Particle was a smaller verison to first understand the basics.
Advanced Physics was another assignment about using physics in unity. However is the unfinished version.
